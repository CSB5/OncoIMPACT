## Input Data ##
################

# oncoIMPACT requires three data matrix as an input. The order of the samples have to be the same for all three matrixes.

# 1. Full path to cnv matrix. Matrix is a tab-separated file with samples as columns and genes as rows. Value of -1 would indicate DELETION while value of 1 will indicate AMPLIFICATION.
cnv=input/CNV_5samples.txt

# 2. Full path to expression matrix. Matrix is a tab-separated file with samples as columns and genes as rows. Values would represent the log fold-change for the respective gene.
exp=input/EXPR_5samples.txt

# 3. Full path to snp boolean matrix. Matrix is a tab-separated file with samples as columns and genes as rows. Binary values would represent a snp for a gene with 1 and 0 otherwise.

# Flag for expression data type. [Valid options: ARRAY, RNA_SEQ]
dataType=ARRAY

# Uncomment if the input data type is different from the data type of the database
