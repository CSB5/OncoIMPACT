If compiling with option -O3 or -O2, I get this error :

c:\mingw\include\math.h: In function 'float hypotf(float, float)':
c:\mingw\include\math.h:635:30: error: '_hypot' was not declared in this scope
{ return (float)(_hypot (x, y)); }

A workaround mentioned there is to use -D__NO_INLINE__ to the compiler options.


Right-click on the the project and select "Properties"
Navigate to C/C++ Build -> Settings
Select the Tool Settings tab.
Navigate to GCC C++ Compiler -> Miscellaneous
In the option setting labeled Other Flags add -std=c++11
